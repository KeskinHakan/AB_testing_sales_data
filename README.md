AB Testing for the Sales Conversion Dataset

This dataset includes A/B test results of Sales and impressions of the two advertising method. To examine what happens when the two methods use for the advertising process and to see difference the results are occurred accidentally or not. In this study, we will try to find out whether methods effected to sales or impressions or not.

A/B testing (also known as split testing or bucket testing) is a methodology for comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better. A/B testing is essentially an experiment where two or more variants of a page are shown to users at random, and statistical analysis is used to determine which variation performs better for a given conversion goal.

Running an A/B test that directly compares a variation against a current experience lets you ask focused questions about changes to your website or app and then collect data about the impact of that change.

Testing takes the guesswork out of website optimization and enables data-informed decisions that shift business conversations from "we think" to "we know." By measuring the impact that changes have on your metrics, you can ensure that every change produces positive results.
